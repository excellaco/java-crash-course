**Version 1.0**

###### If you have any questions / concerns, need further assistance, or need to expense any online courses, please contact your supervisor or the Java Capabilities Area Lead: [kenneth.russell@excella.com](mailto:kenneth.russell@excella.com).

## Overview

**What is this for?**<br />
This is a reference guide to learn the most essential Java and Spring Boot concepts in order to be able to contribute as a Java developer when staffed.

**Who is this for?**<br />
Junior / Mid-Level developers who have experience with other languages and would like to learn Java and Spring Boot.

**How does this work?**<br/>
The Java / Spring Crash Course is not intended to be work like a typical online course. Each section / topic is meant to be *Ã  la carte*; pick and choose topics / concepts you're unfamiliar with to fill in any knowledge gaps you may have.

**Need to learn the most bare-bone concepts required to contribute as a Java dev?**<br/>
Everything under **[Core Concepts](#core-concepts)** are things you *should* understand before starting as a Java developer on a project. See: **[Essential Java](java.md)** and **[Spring Boot](spring.md)**.

**Have a good grasp of the basics?**<br/>
Learn some **[advanced topics](advanced.md)** that are commonly used on most projects.

**Want to learn how Spring Boot connects with everything else?**<br/>
We recommend you read through the **[Integration and Microservices](integration.md)** section.

**How can I get more hands-on when learning concepts in this guide?**<br/>
**[Spring Reactor Template](https://github.com/excellalabs/spring-reactor-template)** is a simple Spring application that we use as a template to create new microservices on some of our projects. 


## Core Concepts

### 1) [Essential Java](java.md#essential-java)

Fundamental concepts (mostly Java-specific). We recommend learning / understanding all of these concepts before going through any of the **[Spring Boot](spring.md)** content.

If you're still new to development and need to learn core foundations / basic concepts, we recommend you go through the **[Java Tech College Handbook](https://github.com/excellaco/java-tech-college-handbook)**.

- [Basic OOP](java.md#basic-oop)
- [Collections](java.md#collections)
- [Generics](java.md#generics)
- [Bean Validation](java.md#bean-validation)
- [Unit Tests](java.md#unit-tests)
- [Additional Resources](java.md#additional-resources)

### 2) [Spring Boot](spring.md#spring-boot)

This section will help you understand all the core pieces of a Spring Boot application. We recommend going through / understanding **[Essential Java](java.md)** concepts before learning the following topics.

- [What is Spring Boot?](spring.md#what-is-spring-boot)
- [Gradle](spring.md#gradle)
- [Beans](spring.md#beans)
- [Code Structure](spring.md#code-structure)
- [Serialization](spring.md#serialization)
- [Migrations](spring.md#migrations)
- [Additional Resources](spring.md#additional-resources)

## Further Learning

Commonly used concepts, libraries, and tools used when building a typical Java Spring Boot microservice.

- **[Java](advanced.md#java)**
	- [Advanced Bean Validation](advanced.md#advanced-bean-validation)
	- [Streams API](advanced.md#streams-api)
	- [Reactive Programming](advanced.md#reactive-programming)

- **[Spring Boot](advanced.md#spring-boot)**
	- [JPA / Hibernate (with Spring Boot)](advanced.md#jpa--hibernate)
	- [Integration Testing](advanced.md#integration-testing)
	- [Spring Security](advanced.md#spring-security)

### 4) [Integration and Microservices](integration.md#integration-and-microservices)

Learn how to containerize, deploy, and integrate your Spring Boot app with other microservices. Coming soon!

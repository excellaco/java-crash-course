# Java / Spring Crash Course

**Version 1.0**

The Java / Spring Crash Course is a guide for junior/mid-level developers to learn the most essential Java / Spring concepts in order to be able to contribute as a Java developer when staffed.

This is intended to be treated as a course; each topic is meant to be *Ã  la carte*; **choose topics / concepts you're unfamiliar with to fill in any knowledge gaps you may have.**

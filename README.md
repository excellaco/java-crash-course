# Java / Spring Crash Course

**Version 1.0**

This is a reference guide (specifically for junior/mid-level developers) to learn the most essential Java / Spring concepts in order to be able to contribute as a Java developer when staffed.

###### If you have any questions / concerns, need further assistance, or need to expense any online courses, please contact your supervisor or the Java Capabilities Area Lead: [kenneth.russell@excella.com](mailto:kenneth.russell@excella.com).

## How This Works

The **Java / Spring Crash Course** is not intended to be work like a typical online course. Each section / topic is meant to be **Ã  la carte**; pick and choose topics / concepts you're unfamiliar with to fill in any knowledge gaps you may have.

**Are you coming from another language and need to learn the most essential basics?**<br/>
Fundamental concepts that you *should* know before you are staffed on a project can be found in [Essential Java](java.md) and [Spring Boot](spring.md).

**Already have a good grasp of the basics?**<br/>
Try learning more [Advanced Concepts](advanced.md) that are commonly used on most projects.

**Want to understand how a Spring Boot microservice connects with everything else?**<br/>
We recommend you read through the [Integration](integration.md) section.

## Topics

### 1) [Essential Java](java.md#essential-java)

Fundamental concepts (mostly Java-specific). We recommend learning / understanding all of these concepts before going through any of the **[Spring Boot](spring.md)** content.

If you're still new to development and need to learn core foundations / basic concepts, we recommend you go through the **[Java Tech College Handbook](https://github.com/excellaco/java-tech-college-handbook)**.

- [Basic OOP](java.md#basic-oop)
- [Collections](java.md#collections)
- [Generics](java.md#generics)
- [Bean Validation](java.md#bean-validation)
- [Unit Tests](java.md#unit-tests)

### 2) [Spring Boot](spring.md#spring-boot)

The most basic. We recommend going through / understanding **[Essential Java](java.md)** concepts before learning the following topics.

- [What is Spring Boot?](spring.md#what-is-spring-boot)
- [Gradle](spring.md#gradle)
- [Beans](spring.md#beans)
- [Design Patterns](spring.md#design-patterns)
- [Serialization](spring.md#serialization)
- [Migrations](spring.md#migrations)

### 3) [Advanced](advanced.md#advanced)

Commonly used concepts, libraries, and tools used when building a typical Java Spring Boot API.

- **[Java](advanced.md#java)**
	- [Advanced Bean Validation](advanced.md#advanced-bean-validation)
	- [Streams API](advanced.md#streams-api)
	- [Reactive API](advanced.md#reactive-api)


- **[Spring Boot](advanced.md#spring-boot)**
	- [JPA / Hibernate (with Spring Boot)](advanced.md#jpa--hibernate)
	- [Integration Testing](advanced.md#integration-testing)
	- [Spring Security](advanced.md#spring-security)

### 4) [Integration](integration.md#integration)

Learn how to containerize, deploy, and integrate your Spring Boot app with other microservices. Coming soon!

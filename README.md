## About

<u>**What is this for?**</u><br />
This is a reference guide to learn the most essential Java and Spring Boot concepts in order to be able to contribute as a Java developer when staffed.

<u>**Who is this for?**</u><br />
Junior / Mid-Level developers who have experience with other languages and would like to learn Java and Spring Boot.

<u>**How does this work?**</u><br/>
The Java / Spring Crash Course is not intended to be work like a typical online course. Each section / topic is meant to be *Ã  la carte*; pick and choose topics / concepts you're unfamiliar with to fill in any knowledge gaps you may have.

<u>**Need to learn the most bare-bone concepts required to contribute as a Java dev?**</u><br/>
Everything under **[Core Concepts](#core-concepts)** are things you *should* understand before starting as a Java developer on a project. See: **[Essential Java](java.md)** and **[Spring Boot](spring.md)**.

<u>**Have a good grasp of the basics?**</u><br/>
Learn some **[advanced topics](advanced.md)** that are commonly used on most projects.

<u>**Want to learn how Spring Boot connects with everything else?**</u><br/>
We recommend you read through the **[Integration and Microservices](integration.md)** section.

## Core Concepts

### 1) [Essential Java](java.md#essential-java)

Fundamental concepts (mostly Java-specific). We recommend learning / understanding all of these concepts before going through any of the **[Spring Boot](spring.md)** content.

If you're still new to development and need to learn core foundations / basic concepts, we recommend you go through the **[Java Tech College Handbook](https://github.com/excellaco/java-tech-college-handbook)**.

- [Basic OOP](java.md#basic-oop)
- [Collections](java.md#collections)
- [Generics](java.md#generics)
- [Bean Validation](java.md#bean-validation)
- [Unit Tests](java.md#unit-tests)

### 2) [Spring Boot](spring.md#spring-boot)

The most basic. We recommend going through / understanding **[Essential Java](java.md)** concepts before learning the following topics.

- [What is Spring Boot?](spring.md#what-is-spring-boot)
- [Gradle](spring.md#gradle)
- [Beans](spring.md#beans)
- [Design Patterns](spring.md#design-patterns)
- [Serialization](spring.md#serialization)
- [Migrations](spring.md#migrations)
